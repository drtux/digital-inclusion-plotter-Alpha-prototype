#Home Office Digital's Digital Inclusion Plotter (DIP)

This is not finished! It's a Alpha prototype!

##Getting started
Click on the green 'download or clone' button, then download zip. Unzip the foler to a location of your choosing.
- To load the basic version (aka not gov.uk styles) you just need to open index.html
- For the full gov-like stylings you will need to run up a server using the run.command file, then visit http://localhost:1987/ (this may be disabled on you computers)

##User feedback
Please remember to note down your opinion of the participants Digital Inclusion category, and the tools decision, before clicking continue. If you have any comments/queries on the questions & hint text please not them down as well. This will help us to iterate on DIP. 

##Please note: 
- Occasionally when you modify earlier questions in your route a bug occurs that causes DIP to 'freeze'. For now the fix is to refresh the page
- DIP has only been tested in Chrome
